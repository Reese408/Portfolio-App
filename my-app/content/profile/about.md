# About Me

Hi, I'm **Reese Redman** - an enthusiastic Computer Science and CyberSecurity student with a deep passion for learning and problem solving.

## What I Do

I'm a full-stack developer and cybersecurity enthusiast currently pursuing my degree at Ashland University. I specialize in:

- **Full-Stack Web Development** - Building scalable applications with React, Next.js, Node.js, and Django
- **CyberSecurity** - Implementing secure authentication, data protection, and compliance frameworks
- **System Design** - Creating robust architectures for real-world applications
- **Cloud & DevOps** - Working with Docker, Linux, and learning AWS solutions architecture

## My Approach

I thrive in collaborative environments and love tackling complex challenges. Whether it's building a multiplayer gaming platform with Socket.io, implementing secure data destruction processes for enterprise clients, or creating custom web applications, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems.

## Background

I'm currently a student-athlete at Ashland University, balancing my Computer Science & CyberSecurity studies with competitive wrestling. I've been recognized with the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Award for academic excellence in computing and the Scholar All-American award for outstanding academic and athletic performance.

Through my internships at Techr2 and CNC Construction, I've gained hands-on experience with data security compliance, full-stack development, and delivering production-ready solutions under real-world constraints.

## Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me on the wrestling mat, leading Bible study discussions as a Huddle Leader, or working on side projects with my ACM club team. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow both technically and personally.
